# RockPaperScissorsGame-Using-JavaScript
Hi, Welcome to the game! Here, I have create a rock, paper and scissors game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game is played between a user and computer. The user has to click on 'Rock', 'Paper' and 'Scissor' as per their wish. This is a very simple project which I have done while learning JavaScript which I believe will definitely add to my development knowledge. 
Don't forget to play the game!!
